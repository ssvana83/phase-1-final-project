# Happy Hour Helper
Happy Hour Helper is an app for dealing with cocktail making. It is a website that is a handy tool for any party host!
This will be the overview for my project. I will detail what my project is about and its purpose


# OVERVIEW OF WHAT I AM GOING TO BE BUILDING/DESCRIPTION
You've got to host a party! You need to figure out what tyope of cocktails you are going to serve for the party!
This app will help you search and plan what drinks you should make for the big day!
1. You will be able to enter a liquor type in the search bar to access the list of drinks from an API and view each of them in a "card" on the page under search  results. 
2. You will be able to view the instructions on how to make the drinks you searched for on each drink card. 
3. You will have the ability to click a like button to "like" a drink 
4. When the button is clicked, the number of likes should be updated in the database and the updated information should be rendered to the
DOM to be viewed on the drink card
